# Double Horn Fingering Dictionary
This is a printable reference sheet for double horn fingerings.
It includes several common and uncommon fingerings for B-flat and F horn,
as well as approximate tuning deviations that can be expected for each pitch.

The idea for this came about when I had a valve string snap during a dress rehearsal.
I had to figure out some alternate fingerings on-the-fly,
some of which were wildly out of tune.
A sheet like this would have come in handy!
(After three more instances of valve strings snapping over the course of six months,
I've since concluded that the instrument is haunted,
and exchanged it.)
